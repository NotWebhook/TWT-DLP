# TWT-DLP
This is a basic hobby project made in Python designed to download images/videos from Twitter. 

# Just a fair warning..
Sadly thanks to Twitter's dumb API changes, this is only usuable if you pay Twitter API V2 Pro tier.

You need your API keys as usual, and this runs in a Flask application. So please look at your python command prompt to find the IP.
